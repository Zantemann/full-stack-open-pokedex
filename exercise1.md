CI setup for Java Application Development

In a team of six developers it is useful to set up CI pipeline to ensure quality of code, maintainability and smooth releases. The project is coded with Java, and there are few steps to setup CI process including linting, testing and building.

To begin, configuring code linting is crucial. Java offers a few tools like CheckStyle and PMD for linting. These tools warn developers about style issues, code violations and maintainability problems. The next step is testing. The most popular testing framework for Java is JUnit, which allows developers to write and execute unit tests to ensure the accuracy of individual components. The final step is building, where build automation tools like Apache Maven or Gradle manage project dependencies, compile the source code, and package the application for deployment.

There is few cloud-based CI/CD service alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions for CI setup. First example is Travis CI, which provides excellent support for Java projects and integrates well with GitHub repositories. It offers a simple configuration and a scalable infrastructure. Second example is CircleCI, which supports Java applications. CircleCI provides customizable workflows and fast build times.

Choosing between a self-hosted and a cloud-based environment depends on various factors. In the case of this small team, a cloud-based environment seems preferable as it eliminates the need for managing infrastructure expertise, saving time and resources. Moreover, cloud-based environments offer easy scalability for future growth. While self-hosted platforms may have some advantages in certain scenarios. There is also few things like cost and security that should be considered when choosing between environments. Based on the preceding factors, I think a cloud-based environment is a better option for this small team.
